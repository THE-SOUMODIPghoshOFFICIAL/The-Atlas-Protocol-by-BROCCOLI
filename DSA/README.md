Welcome to the DSA hub — a compact, high-energy workspace to master Data Structures & Algorithms from zero → advanced. This interactive README helps you pick a path, track progress, and jump straight into coding.

## About

This folder collects two focused guides: a full roadmap and the math foundations you need to reason about algorithms. Use the checklist below to turn reading into action.

## Files

- [complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md](complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md): End-to-end study roadmap and milestones.
- [math_for_dsa_roadmap.md](math_for_dsa_roadmap.md): Core math concepts (combinatorics, number theory, discrete math) mapped to algorithms.

## Quick start

<details>
<summary><strong>Pick a 60–90 minute session (click to expand)</strong></summary>

1. Open [complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md](complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md) and pick the first module.
2. Read the short goal for the module (10–15 minutes).
3. Implement one data structure or algorithm from scratch (30–40 minutes).
4. Solve 2–3 practice problems applying that concept (20–30 minutes).
5. Write a 2–3 sentence note about the trick you used and where you struggled.

</details>

## Interactive checklist

Use this task list to track hands-on progress. Check items directly on GitHub as you complete them.

- [ ] Read the roadmap ([complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md](complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md))
- [ ] Read the math primer ([math_for_dsa_roadmap.md](math_for_dsa_roadmap.md))
- [ ] Implement `Array` & `String` helpers from scratch
- [ ] Implement `Stack`, `Queue`, `LinkedList`
- [ ] Solve 5 problems on one topic (e.g., trees)
- [ ] Write 3 short notes (one per weak topic)

Tip: turn this checklist into an issue or project board if you want kanban-style tracking.

## Study path

<details>
<summary><strong>Core progression (click to expand)</strong></summary>

- Foundations: complexity, arrays, strings, pointers.
- Core structures: stacks, queues, linked lists, hash maps, trees, heaps.
- Graphs & DP: BFS/DFS, shortest paths, topological sort, knapsack, LIS.
- Advanced: segment trees, suffix arrays, max-flow, randomized algorithms.

</details>

## Tips & habits

- Timebox learning sessions to 60–90 minutes.
- Implement every structure from scratch at least once.
- After solving, write a 3-line explanation of the trick you used.
- Keep a short weekly review: 2–3 topics to revisit.

## Resources

- Competitive practice: LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder
- Books: CLRS (select chapters), Elements of Programming Interviews
- Video courses: pick one lecture series and follow it end-to-end

## Contributing

- Add new notes, problem sets, or cheat-sheets as separate files.
- Use clear filenames and a 1-paragraph intro so future-you can scan quickly.
