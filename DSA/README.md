# DSA — The Atlas Roadmap

Welcome to the DSA hub — a compact, high-energy starting point for mastering Data Structures & Algorithms from zero to advanced. This folder collects learning plans, math foundations, and curated paths to become a confident problem solver.

**What's here**

- complete_dsa_roadmap_forZEROtoAdv.md: End-to-end study roadmap and milestones.
- math_for_dsa_roadmap.md: Core math concepts (combinatorics, number theory, discrete math) mapped to algorithms.

**Why this folder**

- Focused: study milestones, practice strategies, and concept sequencing.
- Practical: maps math to algorithmic thinking and contest-style problems.
- Portable: copy or link these notes into your own study repo or notes app.

**Quick study path**

1. Foundations: complexity, arrays, strings, pointers.
2. Core structures: stacks, queues, linked lists, hash maps, trees, heaps.
3. Graphs & DP: BFS/DFS, shortest paths, topological sort, knapsack, LIS.
4. Advanced topics: segment trees, suffix arrays, flow, randomized algorithms.
5. Practice loop: learn → implement → solve 10 problems → review.

**Study tips**

- Timebox learning sessions to 60–90 minutes.
- Implement every structure from scratch once.
- After solving, write a 3-line explanation of the trick you used.
- Track weak topics and revisit with focused problem sets.

**Resources**

- Competitive practice: LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder
- Books: CLRS (select chapters), Elements of Programming Interviews
- Video courses: choose one lecture series and follow it end-to-end

**Contributing**

- Add new notes, problem sets, or cheat-sheets as separate files.
- Use clear filenames and short intros so future-you can scan quickly.

Happy studying — build, break, fix, repeat. 🚀
