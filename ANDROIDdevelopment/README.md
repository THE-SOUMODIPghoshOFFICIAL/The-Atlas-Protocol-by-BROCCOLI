**Quick Links**

- 📁 Structure: projects · tutorials · assets · docs
- ⚡ Quick start: build, run, iterate
- ✨ Goal: practical examples + clean notes

---

## Contents

- `projects/` — small, focused sample apps
- `tutorials/` — step-by-step guides and how-tos
- `assets/` — images, icons, mock JSON
- `docs/` — design notes, architecture sketches

## Quick Start

1. Install Android Studio and Android SDK.
2. Open any sample in Android Studio or build via Gradle from the project folder.

Windows (project root):

```bash
./gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Linux / macOS (if applicable):

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Features & Conventions

- Kotlin-first: new samples use Kotlin and modern Android APIs
- Minimal dependencies: samples should run locally without extra setup
- Self-contained: each sample keeps its own README with build + run steps

## Example Workflow

1. Pick a sample from `projects/`.
2. Open in Android Studio, run on emulator or device.
3. Modify a screen or feature, rebuild with `./gradlew assembleDebug`.

## Resources

- Android docs: https://developer.android.com
- Kotlin: https://kotlinlang.org

## Want more?

If you'd like, I can scaffold `projects/`, `tutorials/`, `assets/`, and add a starter sample app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose). Tell me which starter (e.g., "Todo app" or "Camera sample") and I'll create it.
