## 🎮 What is this?

- A curated hub for game development learning, tutorials, and project templates.
- Covers game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot), mechanics, graphics, and publishing pipelines.
- Designed for indie devs, students, and studios building games from scratch.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Engine-agnostic guides** — learn core concepts applicable across all engines.
- **Roadmap to shipped games** — design, prototype, iterate, polish, ship.
- **Full-stack templates** — 2D/3D projects, networking, physics, AI, UI systems.
- **Art & Audio notes** — sprite workflows, 3D modeling, sound design checklists.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and explore the `GAMEdevelopment` folder.
2. Open `game-developer-map.pdf` for a high-level roadmap.
3. Pick an engine and tutorial project that matches your skill level.
4. Start small: build a simple 2D platformer or puzzle game first.

## Game Dev Roadmap

<details>
<summary><strong>Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced (click to expand)</strong></summary>

### Phase 1: Foundations

- Game loop, event handling, input systems
- Sprites, animation, collision detection
- Basic scene/world management
- 2D top-down or side-scrolling game (first project)

### Phase 2: Intermediate

- Game state machines, UI systems, menus
- Physics engines and rigidbodies
- Particle systems and visual effects
- Audio: music, SFX, mixing basics
- Level design and progression

### Phase 3: Advanced

- 3D graphics and lighting
- Advanced physics, ragdoll systems
- Networking (multiplayer, client-server)
- AI and pathfinding (nav meshes, behavior trees)
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Build pipelines and publishing (Steam, mobile, console)
