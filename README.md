## Overview

**The Atlas Protocol** is built as a long-term resource hub and learning OS for programmers — from beginner to advanced.  
It blends visual guides, roadmaps, code examples, exercises, and curated references into a single navigable library.

This repo is ideal for:

- Focused DSA study with math foundations
- Language-specific roadmaps (C, Python, …)
- Building a portfolio of teaching-quality resources

---

## How to use this repo

- Browse the top-level folders (`DSA`, `PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES`, `ANDROIDdevelopment`, `GAMEdevelopment`, `IOSdevelopment`, `WEB-WARRIOR`, `CYBER_MANIAC`).
- Read roadmaps first (they explain _why_), then explore example code and exercises (they show _how_).
- Use the **Projects** tab to follow tasks and progress (issues → add to Project).
