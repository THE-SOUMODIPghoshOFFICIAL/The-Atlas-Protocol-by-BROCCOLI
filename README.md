## Overview
**The Atlas Protocol** is built as a long-term resource hub and learning OS for programmers — from beginner to advanced.  
It blends visual guides, roadmaps, code examples, exercises, and curated references into a single navigable library.

This repo is ideal for:
- Focused DSA study with math foundations  
- Language-specific roadmaps (C, Python, …)  
- Building a portfolio of teaching-quality resources

---

## How to use this repo
- Browse the top-level folders (DSA, Programming-Languages, Networks).  
- Read roadmaps first (they explain *why*), then explore example code and exercises (they show *how*).  
- Use the **Projects** tab to follow tasks and progress (issues → add to Project).

## File Structure
> The repo is organized as a curated library — each major topic gets its own folder and index file.

## Contributing & Workflow (Projects)
We use **GitHub Projects** to plan content. Typical workflow:
1. Create an **Issue** describing the item (`add pointer examples`)  
2. Assign & add to Atlas **Project** with fields: Repo, Type, Priority, Estimate  
3. Implement in branch → open PR → when merged, automation moves Project item to Done

If you'd like, I can generate initial issues for the C syllabus and add them to a Project for you.

---

## Recommended starter issues (copy into Issues)
- `C: write pointer examples + code snippets`  
- `C: add dynamic array (vector) example`  
- `DSA: add graph math visual diagrams`  
- `Python: create algorithm practice notebook (sorting)`  

---

## Notes on styling & interactivity
- Major blocks are collapsible to keep the page tidy.  
- Badges at the top show repo intent and status.  
- Banner and section images give the repo a consistent cyber-fantasy + premium dev aesthetic.
