## 🧠 Philosophy Behind “The Atlas Protocol”

> “Mathematics is the language of logic,  
>  and algorithms are its dialect.”

This protocol connects the two — transforming abstract math into tangible programming logic.  
It’s designed for self-learners, programmers, and computer science enthusiasts  
who wish to _think like algorithmic architects._

---

## 📅 Future Goals

- 🔹 Add **visual diagrams** for each math concept.
- 🔹 Include **interactive notebooks (Jupyter / Colab)** for practice.
- 🔹 Expand to **“Atlas: Volume II — Applied DSA Math.”**
- 🔹 Add **YouTube video links** for each math principle.
