# CYBER_MANIAC — Project Template

This small template helps you start new projects inside `CYBER_MANIAC` quickly.

Suggested folders

- `recon/` — scans, notes, target lists
- `scripts/` — helper scripts and automation
- `docs/` — findings and writeups
- `data/` — captured outputs (kept separate and ignored by default)

Quick start

1. Copy this folder to `CYBER_MANIAC/<project-name>/`.
2. Edit `README.md` with project context and objectives.
3. Add a short `SCOPE.md` explaining what is allowed for this project.

Safety note

Only run experiments against systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
