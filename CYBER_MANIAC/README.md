## 🔭 What is this?

- A curated sandbox for bold cybersecurity experiments, proof-of-concepts, and learning resources.
- Use it as a personal lab, demo repo, or idea vault for cyber projects.

## ✨ Highlights

- Quick-start layouts for pen-testing exercises and red-team notes.
- Templates for documenting exploits, reconnaissance, and mitigation.
- Minimal, opinionated structure so you can iterate fast.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo and open the `CYBER_MANIAC` folder in your preferred editor.
- Create a subfolder for a project (e.g., `recon/`, `payloads/`, `writeups/`) and start adding notes.

## Recommended structure

- `recon/` — scan results, asset inventories, scripts
- `exploits/` — PoC code and exploitation notes (clearly labeled and responsibly used)
- `writeups/` — lessons learned, mitigations, and postmortems

## Usage & Safety

- This repository is intended for learning and responsible research only.
- Do not use any contained tools or techniques against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## Contributing

- Open an issue or PR with improvements, templates, or sanitized writeups.
- Use clear labeling: `TOOL`, `POC`, `WRITEUP`, `SCAN`.

## License & Contact

- Check the repository root `LICENSE` for licensing information.
- Questions or collabs: open an issue in the main repo.

Have fun—stay curious and stay ethical. ⚡
